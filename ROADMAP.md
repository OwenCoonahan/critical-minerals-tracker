# Critical Minerals Tracker — Product Roadmap

## Vision
Import Genius meets Bloomberg Terminal for critical minerals. A platform people bookmark and return to.

## Moat
Aggregating mineral supply chain data scattered across 40+ sources into one clean interface.

## Phases

### v1 — Content Magnet ✅ SHIPPED
- Static data, beautiful viz, Sankey flows
- 14 minerals, overview grid, detail views
- Dark/light mode, Geist fonts, shadcn aesthetic
- Live: owencoonahan.github.io/critical-minerals-tracker

### v2 — Tool (NEXT)
- UN Comtrade trade data (real import/export volumes between countries, quarterly updates)
- World Bank commodity pricing charts (monthly updates)
- This gives people a reason to come BACK

### v3 — Product
- Company-level tracking (search company → see full mineral supply chain)
- Mine locations on interactive map (USGS MRDS, 300K+ locations)
- Search by company / mineral / country
- Country profiles (click country → see everything they export, import, refine)

### v4 — Business
- Live/regular data updates
- Custom alerts ("notify me when China restricts gallium exports")
- API access (paid tiers)
- News/policy integration (tariffs, export bans, mine approvals)
- Supply disruption tracking

## What Makes People Return
- Data that changes (pricing, trade flows, news)
- Tools they can't get elsewhere (company supply chain search, country profiles)
- Alerts on things they care about

## Data Sources (see DATA_SOURCES.md)
- Free stack: USGS + UN Comtrade API + USGS MRDS + World Bank
- Paid (later): S&P Global, Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, Fastmarkets
