- **Germanium** — IR optics for night vision (AN/PVS-14), missile seekers, satellite solar arrays
- **Tungsten** — armor-piercing penetrators (120mm tank rounds), kinetic energy weapons
- **Cobalt** — superalloys for jet engine turbine blades (F119, F135 engines)
- **Titanium** — airframe structures (F-35 uses ~15% titanium by weight)

**Tier 2 — Important / Broad Defense Use:**
- **Lithium** — military battery systems, submarine batteries
- **Beryllium** — aerospace structures, nuclear weapons components
- **Manganese** — steel alloys for armored vehicles, naval vessels
- **Vanadium** — high-strength steel for armor, aerospace

### Defense Supply Chain Vulnerability Assessment

| Vulnerability | Details |
|---|---|
| **Single-point-of-failure: China** | 90%+ of rare earth processing, 98% gallium, 90%+ battery-grade graphite — a conflict over Taiwan could sever these supplies overnight |
| **Single-point-of-failure: DRC** | 73% of cobalt mining — political instability, conflict minerals, artisanal mining |
| **Russia dependency** | 40% of palladium, 35-40% of uranium enrichment, 11% of titanium sponge (VSMPO-AVISMA was Boeing/Airbus primary supplier) |
| **No domestic processing** | US has essentially zero capacity for rare earth separation, gallium refining, graphite processing, manganese refining |
| **Stockpile gaps** | National Defense Stockpile (managed by DLA Strategic Materials) is severely underfunded relative to identified shortfalls. FY2024 stockpile valued at ~$1B vs. estimated $15B+ in shortfalls |
| **Timeline to build** | New mines take 10-15 years to permit and build in the US. Processing plants take 3-7 years. China can build in 2-3 years |

**Endpoints:** `/defense-system/{system}/materials`, `/vulnerability-score/{mineral}/defense`, `/stockpile-coverage/{mineral}`
**Monetization:** Government/defense pricing — $999/mo+. Could pursue GSA schedule.

### Idea 6: ESG & Conflict Minerals Compliance API
**What:** Track artisanal mining risk, forced labor risk, environmental violations by mine/facility. Support EU Critical Raw Materials Act, UFLPA, SEC conflict minerals (Dodd-Frank 1502) compliance.
**Users:** Corporate compliance, legal teams, ESG fund managers.
**Endpoints:** `/compliance/{mineral}/risk-score`, `/facility/{id}/esg-flags`, `/supply-chain/audit-trail`
**Monetization:** Enterprise SaaS — $1000-5000/mo depending on query volume

### Idea 7: Project Pipeline & Investment Intelligence API
**What:** Track every announced mining/processing project globally. Status, timeline, capex, offtake agreements, permitting status, government funding received.
**Users:** Mining investors, venture capital, investment banks, government agencies.
**Endpoints:** `/projects?mineral=lithium&country=US&status=construction`, `/project/{id}/timeline`, `/investment-flows/{mineral}?year=2024`
**Monetization:** $299/mo (basic), $799/mo (full detail + alerts)
